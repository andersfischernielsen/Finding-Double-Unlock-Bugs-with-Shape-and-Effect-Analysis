\section{Future Work}

\noindent Extending using the implementation of the EBA analyzer has proven to provide a foundation for analyzing the Linux kernel components, allowing building an error checker able to process these files with relative ease. 
Building error checkers for other error types would allow the EBA analyzer to validate the source code for Linux components while possibly detecting more error types. \\

\noindent Extending the analyzer in this plugin-style furthermore allows the user(s) of the analyzer to only check for specific error types, speeding up evaluation of source code.
